<img src="./assets/logo.png" alt="Python Logo" width="200">

This lesson is designed to help JavaScript developers understand the basic syntax and structure of Python code.

## Lesson Objectives

- Understand the basic syntax and structure of Python code
- Learn how to define and call functions in Python
- Introduce control flow statements: if, elif, else
- Compare Python's control flow statements to JavaScript's
- Use and, or and not statements
- Write and execute simple Python programs using functions, control flow, and the print() function


### Remember to:

- create a new virtual environment for this lesson

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

- select the Python interpreter in your IDE
- choose `install` when asked to install the ipykernel package

**Note** In the bottom right corner of the screen, hover over the `Cursor Tab` and in the box, choose `Disable Globally`. Also choose `disabled` in the `Cursor Prediction` dropbox. This will enable you to create the code on your own without the help of Cursor. Creating the functions yourself will help you learn the material.
